# GeneriCrawl

A WIP stock-standard roguelike made with Python and libtcod as part of the 2018 [r/roguelikedev Does The Complete 
Roguelike Tutorial](https://redd.it/8ql895) event.

To play it yourself, you'll need to have Python 3 installed (download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). Then,
download the source code and run ``engine.py`` (double-click it or run ``python engine.py`` from a terminal).
